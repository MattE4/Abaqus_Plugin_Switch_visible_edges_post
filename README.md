# Abaqus_Plugin_Switch_visible_edges_post
Plugin for Abaqus/CAE to quickly switch the visible edges in postprocessing

<br>
Plugin to quickly switch the visible edges in postprocessing. I use that action a lot, so I wanted a faster way to do it.
The plugin has no UI. Each call will switch between Exterior and Feature edges.

<br>
With the plugin it is now possible to use a custom toolbar and a custom button, that refers to the plugin.
This allows to make that switch by a click on that button. Go to Tools->Customize to create the toolbar and make the button assignment.
Ive simple reused the Mesh Region icon/button. You can also (or just) assign a shortcut to this plugin.
Be aware, that the button will be visible in all modules, but it will only work in the Visualization module.

The screenshot in the Media folder shows my custom buttom.

Usage on your own risk.
